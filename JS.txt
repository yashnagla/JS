How website front-end works (client-side)?
A web-site uses three entities to work properly:-
1.HTML/HTML5:-
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
It is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
It describes the structure of a web page.
2. CSS/CSS3:-
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

With CSS, we can control the color, font, size of text, etc.

Naming Variables:- Rules and Best Practices:-
The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_) or an dollar($). We can't use a number as the first character.
The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number or underscore. Can't use any other characters, including spaces.
Variable names are case sensitive.
No limit to the length of the variable name.
You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name.
